[Video: Computers Follow Instructions Part 02](https://vimeo.com/340142855/4361162baf)

This lecture covers:
- Directories: Root directory, home directory and how to change directories (command cd)
- Commands:
- You will learn that commands are actually files with low level commands for the computer to do a particular thing, like list the contents of a directory (ls)
  - ls - short for list - lists what's in the directory
  - echo - returns whatever you typed in quotes
  - which - tells you which directory a command is in
  - touch - creates a file
  - vim - a program that contains a command (called vim) that allows you to edit what is in a file
  - mv - renames a file

    Commands are just files.  
    
    "Running commands" is just "running files".
    
    "Running a file" just means that you open the file and run the instructions contained in the file. It's like a football team opening the playbook and running a play by following the instructions for the chosen play.
    
    If running a command is just running a file, where are these files? How does the computer know where to look for them? How do some files get registered as commands, and other files are just files?
    
    Well, there is a list of directories called the PATH. The directories listed in your computer's PATH are the directories that your computer looks in when it's trying to run your command. All these commands like "cd", "ls", "echo", "mv", etc. are filenames. So when you try to run a command, the computer looks for a file with the same name as the command you're trying to run.
    
    This video was compressed with the following command:
    
    `ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -c:a copy -crf 20 output.mov`
    
    which reduced the video file size from 2.37GB to 377.1MB
